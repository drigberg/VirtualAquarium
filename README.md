## About

This is an interactive 3D aquarium built with Unity and Blender! It was designed during lockdown 2020 because I missed the ocean.

See it live at https://danielrigberg.com/virtual_aquarium/index.html!

## Wishlist

### Gameplay

- first-person view
- walking on the bottom
- ocean guardians who can speak

### Fauna behavior

- all fish avoid player
- small fish that patrol only in coral reefs
- patrolling fish may rest at targets, with paused animation at rest pose
- curved paths to targets, or curves that connect multiple targets!

### Flora and Fauna

- more colors of each model
- barracuda
- blue whale
- jellyfish
- shark
- squid
- sea turtle
- glowing fish, coral, and algae in the dark
- patrolling mermaid

### Structures
